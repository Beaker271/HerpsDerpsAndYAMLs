# Q. What is this file?
# A. This file contains options which allow you to configure your multiworld experience while allowing
#    others to play how they want as well.
#
# Q. How do I use it?
# A. The options in this file are weighted. This means the higher number you assign to a value, the
#    more chances you have for that option to be chosen. For example, an option like this:
#
#    map_shuffle:
#      on: 5
#      off: 15
#
#    Means you have 5 chances for map shuffle to occur, and 15 chances for map shuffle to be turned
#    off.
#
# Q. I've never seen a file like this before. What characters am I allowed to use?
# A. This is a .yaml file. You are allowed to use most characters.
#    To test if your yaml is valid or not, you can use this website:
#        http://www.yamllint.com/
#    You can also verify your Archipelago settings are valid at this site:
#        https://archipelago.gg/check

# Your name in-game. Spaces will be replaced with underscores and there is a 16-character limit.
#     {player} will be replaced with the player's slot number.
#     {PLAYER} will be replaced with the player's slot number, if that slot number is greater than 1.
#     {number} will be replaced with the counter value of the name.
#     {NUMBER} will be replaced with the counter value of the name, if the counter value is greater than 1.

    # this option reduces the need for a long "ammo hunt" before fighting Mother Brain if the player has not found Charge Beam.

  mother_brain_short:

    # - Vanilla: The fight behaves as in the vanilla game. Some cutscenes are accelerated, but only in ways that 
    # should not interfere with how the player executes the fight (including the stand-up glitch).
    # - Short: The fight ends immediately after Mother Brain finishes the first Rainbow Beam attack.
    # - Skip: The fight is skipped entirely.
    # 
    # With the "Short" and "Skip" options, Samus will not get an energy refill before the escape, as the cutscene is 
    # skipped where the refill would normally happen. However, Samus will always collect Hyper Beam.

  escape_enemies_cleared:

    # 
    # If this option is disabled, in many rooms enemies will cause heavy lag and visual glitches during the escape 
    # (much of which is vanilla game behavior but not normally observable in casual play).
    # 
    # Note that regardless of whether or not this option is enabled, currently the randomizer opens up major 
    # barriers during the escape (though a future version of the randomizer might make these behaviors become 
    # part of the same option):

    # to compensate for not being refilled by the Baby Metroid.
    # 
    # If this option is disabled, it is possible that the escape may require having collected Reserve Tanks 
    # and/or manipulating Mother Brain to end the fight with more energy (up to 340, by damaging down correctly 
    # and disabling suits).

    # The escape timer is based on an assumption that the player has all these items available. By granting them
    # with Hyper Beam, it avoids the possibility of the player needing to hunt for movement items in order to 
    # complete the escape fast enough.

    # Note: Regardless of this setting, in this randomizer Hyper Beam always breaks bomb blocks, Super blocks,
    # and Power Bomb blocks and can open blue/green gates from either side.

  transition_letters:

    # - Majors: Unique items, E-Tanks, and Reserve Tanks are marked with large solid dots; other items are marked with small dots.
    # - Uniques: Unique items are marked with large solid dots; other items are marked with small dots.
    # - 3Tiered: Unique items are marked with large solid dots; Supers, Power Bombs, E-Tanks, and Reserve

  all_items_spawn:

    #   spawn until after Phantoon is defeated, when the rooms change to appearing "powered on".

    #   awakened.
    # - The item in Pit Room does not spawn until entering with Morph and Missiles collected.
    # 
    # These conditions are apparently unintended artifacts of how the game was coded and are not normally 
    # observable during casual play of the vanilla game. However, they can frequently be observed in the 
    # randomizer, which can be counter-intuitive for players. When this quality-of-life option is enabled, these

  fast_elevators:
    # If enabled, Samus moves up and down elevators at a faster speed.

    # - The fade-in and fade-out of the pause menu is faster.
    # - Fade-in and fade-out are faster when switching between map and equipment screens with L & R.
    # - Fade-in and fade-out are faster when switching between maps with Select.
    # - Diagonal scrolling is enabled on the map screen.
    # Changes are avoided that could meaningfully affect pause buffering strats or game behavior:

    # - Fade-in of gameplay while unpausing is unaffected.
